# prism-marketing-data

## Summary
This is where I will showcase the presentation slides that I have made based on the Prism Marketing Data Project that I partook in.

## Project
The project involved me maintaining and improving the data pipeline, so that the marketing data can not only be properly structured, but also easier to analyse. During the project, I had to unpivot the marketing data and create data lakes to show the advertising cost metrics of each ad platform for Prism, a simulated e-commerce company.

## Presentation
After the pipeline-maintaining, I had to create a presentation based on the marketing data. I imported the data onto PowerBI through SQL queries and created graphs showing the performance of each ad platform based on KPIs and metrics, such as Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) and Click-Through-Rates (CTR).
